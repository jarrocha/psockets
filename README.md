# pSockets
This is a collection of projects that help in the understanding of the tools
that we use everyday and we take for granted. Some of these tools will be
analyzed on my blog to help newcomers into the field and give back to the 
community. The programs that reach a more mature level will be moved to their 
own repository. 

Tools implemented so far:
----

1. pscan: a tcp 3-way handshake implemented port scanner.
2. psniff: a sniffer using raw sockets.
3. tcp_server: a common tcp server. You can use telnet as client to connect to 
   it.
4. xwbserver: a multi-threaded web server.
5. get_http: a program that captures web pages supporting both IPv4/v6 and DNS
   resolution.
